1. Market analysis of the online gambling industry in Maryland
 "Result" : The online gambling industry in Maryland has significant potential for growth, with market analysis revealing promising revenue trends and a competitive environment. The state legalized sports betting in May 2021 and launched its sports gambling market on November 23, 2022. Maryland allows up to 60 online sportsbook operators to enter the market, making it the most permissive and competitive legal sports wagering market in the US to date. The state also supports minority-owned small businesses and encourages diversity initiatives in sports betting.

Maryland has a population of 6,177,224 and is home to in-state professional teams such as the Baltimore Orioles, Baltimore Ravens, and Washington Football Team. The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Commission regulates the market, with a tax rate of 15 percent, which increases to 17.5 percent on annual mobile wagering revenue above $5 million per operator. The state estimates that sports wagering could generate up to $20 million per year in tax revenue, primarily for public education. However, industry insiders believe that Maryland has the potential to generate much more revenue due to the competitive market landscape.

Online betting is available from day one, with remote registration allowed. Maryland also allows wagering on in-state college teams such as the Maryland Terrapins and the Navy Midshipmen. Given its population and interest in sports, the state could potentially earn billions in sports betting handle each year. However, Maryland does not have a significant sports tourism industry, meaning that the market will predominantly rely on local bettors for revenue.

Recent monthly revenue figures for Maryland sports betting indicate steady growth, reporting $30,620,539 in November 2022, $85,168,804 in December 2022, and $59,601,405 in January 2023. As of November 2022, Maryland reported a total wagering volume of $219,071,374, creating $704,728 in tax revenue for the state. The base tax rate for operators is 15%, increasing to 17.5% for those earning over $5 million in annual mobile wagering revenue. As Maryland moves closer to launch day, the industry is expected to continue growing and attract a variety of sports betting operators, offering new opportunities for bettors and revenue generation for the state.

11. Online gambling advertising regulations in Maryland
The emerging sports betting industry in Maryland is facing criticism due to aggressive marketing tactics, especially concerning welcome bonuses. Maryland has drafted regulations for sports betting ads, but these regulations are vague and do not explicitly prohibit misleading or deceptive language used in promotional offers.

Comparatively, states like Ohio have decided to include specific prohibitions against certain language in their sports betting regulations. One of the main challenges in regulating sports betting adverts stems from the conflict between state and federal broadcasting standards, which will likely require more time to resolve.

With up to 60 potential mobile sports betting licensees in Maryland, the market is expected to witness intense competition. The ultimate decision on the number of sports betting ads will influence how other brands can advertise on television.

As Maryland's sports betting sector begins to take shape, the ethical questions surrounding sportsbook marketing are coming under increased scrutiny. Additionally, the conflict between federal and state broadcasts on sportsbook marketing in the state is a significant issue that needs to be addressed.

In terms of the impact of misleading welcome bonus language, there are ongoing studies being conducted in the state. It is worth noting that Maryland's sports betting marketing regulations have flaws that remain unaddressed in most other markets, posing challenges for regulators to enforce their marketing rules effectively.

11. Online gambling advertising regulations in Maryland
Two bills aimed at limiting sports betting advertising in Maryland have survived the crossover deadline, and are currently moving through the legislative process. The first bill, SB620, seeks to prohibit higher education institutions from partnering with sportsbook operators, such as the University of Maryland's partnership with PointsBet Sportsbook. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate and is now on to the House Appropriations Subcommittee, with a hearing scheduled for March 30.

The second bill, SB621, is a measure to vet and audit sportsbook content. It passed through the Senate late Monday night and moved to the House. The revised version of SB621 removes some provisions of the original bill that were opposed by operators who voiced their concerns during a committee hearing. Sportsbooks are no longer required to submit their content for vetting by independent auditors in Maryland, but they have the option to do so. The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission will still evaluate independent content evaluators and will "license" rather than "accredit" these auditing firms. However, there is no information about associated fees.

A similar measure in West Virginia did not pass prior to the state’s crossover deadline and appears to be dead for 2023. Meanwhile, a variety of cookies are used on websites to improve user experiences by analyzing visitor interactions, load balancing, tracking video preferences, sharing content on social media, and collecting feedback.

11. Online gambling advertising regulations in Maryland
Maryland lawmakers recently passed two bills related to sportsbook advertising during the legislative session. The first bill, SB620, prohibits state universities from entering into marketing deals with sportsbooks that offer commission, bonus, or any other incentive payments based on student participation in sports betting. It also mandates that schools with sportsbook partnerships disclose the full terms of the agreement. This bill could impact the partnership between Maryland and PointsBet, although it remains unclear if the deal included any incentive payments.

The second bill related to sportsbook advertising remains unnamed, with further details yet to be provided. Both bills are currently awaiting the signature of Governor Wes Moore.

In addition to these advertising regulations, the Maryland General Assembly passed SB163 during its 2021 session, which legalized online and retail sports betting in the state. The bill allows licensed operators, including casinos and horse racing tracks, to offer both mobile and retail sports betting. Tax revenue generated from sports betting will be used to fund education in Maryland.

Furthermore, SB621 was passed to create a regulatory framework for sports betting content audit companies. This bill establishes a framework for approving and licensing auditors, as well as evaluating operator content. Both SB163 and SB621 are set to go into effect on July 1, 2021.

Online gambling advertising regulations in Maryland are essential to maintain a responsible and safe environment for consumers engaging in sports betting and other online gambling activities. Although specific regulations may evolve over time and would require consultation with the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency, some general aspects related to online gambling advertising regulations in the state can be summarized as follows:

1. Responsible Gaming: Operators are likely to be required to promote responsible gaming by providing information and resources on their websites to help individuals identify problem gambling behavior and seek help if needed.

2. Age restrictions: Advertisements should clearly state that participants must be at least 21 years of age to engage in online gambling activities, or 18 years of age in certain cases like pari-mutuel wagering on horse racing.

3. Identity Verification: Online gambling operators are required to verify the age and identity of their customers before allowing them to participate in any betting activities. Advertisements should not target or appeal to underage individuals.

4. Truthful and Accurate Advertising: Advertisements must not contain false, misleading, or deceptive information, including any unrealistic or exaggerated claims about the likelihood of winning or potential payouts from wagers.

5. Prohibition of Targeting Vulnerable Audiences: Advertising should not target or exploit vulnerable individuals, including those with psychological or physical susceptibilities, or those suffering from problem gambling issues.

6. Restrictions on Bonus Offers and Promotions: Operators must comply with regulations related to the advertising of bonuses and promotions, ensuring that such offers are transparent, fair, and that terms and conditions are clearly presented.

7. Limitations on Advertising in Certain Media: There may be restrictions on advertising online gambling in specific media channels or during specific times to avoid exposure to children and other vulnerable audiences.

8. Sponsorships and Partnerships: Online gambling operators engaging in sponsorships and partnerships must ensure that such arrangements do not promote irresponsible gambling behavior or violate any regulatory guidelines.

9. Adherence to Advertising Standards: Operators must adhere to industry standards for advertising, such as those set forth by the American Gaming Association or other relevant organizations, to ensure that their advertisements are not offensive, inappropriate, or harmful to individuals or society as a whole.

10. Compliance with Local Laws and Regulations: Online gambling operators must ensure that their advertising practices comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those related to consumer protection and responsible gaming.

11. Penalties for Non-Compliance: Operators found to be in violation of advertising regulations may face penalties, including fines, suspension or revocation of licenses, or other enforcement actions by the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency.

Given the evolving nature of online gambling regulations in Maryland and the recent approval of sports betting licenses in the state, it is crucial for operators and advertisers to stay updated on the latest guidelines and rules applicable to the promotion of online gambling activities.

11. Online gambling advertising regulations in Maryland
Online gambling advertising regulations in Maryland are not explicitly defined, given that the state has only recently legalized online sports betting and daily fantasy sports. However, it is the responsibility of the licensed gambling operators to ensure that their advertising and promotional activities abide by the general guidelines set forth by the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency (MLGCA) and other applicable laws.

Some of the general principles that operators should adhere to while advertising their online gambling products in Maryland include:

1. Preventing underage gambling: Advertisements should not target minors, and operators should avoid using images, themes, or content that may appeal to individuals below the legal gambling age of 21 years for sports betting and daily fantasy sports, and 18 years for horse racing and lottery.

2. Promoting responsible gambling: Operators should promote responsible gambling and provide clear information to players about problem gambling resources, self-exclusion options, and responsible gambling tools available on their platforms.

3. Ensuring fair and transparent communication: Advertising should not be misleading, deceptive, or create unrealistic expectations regarding the odds of winning, payouts, or bonus offers. Operators should display all terms and conditions related to promotions, bonuses, and rewards in a clear and accessible manner.

4. Compliance with industry standards: Online gambling operators should follow the Advertising Best Practices Guidelines provided by industry associations, such as the American Gaming Association (AGA), to ensure that their advertising content is socially responsible, protects the integrity of the industry, and adheres to federal and state regulations.

5. Observing restrictions imposed by media channels: Advertising content should comply with the advertising policies and guidelines of the media channels used for promotion, such as radio, television, print, and social media platforms.

As the online gambling landscape continues to evolve in Maryland, further regulations and guidelines concerning advertising practices could be introduced to govern the industry's promotion activities more specifically. In the meantime, operators must ensure that their advertising tactics align with the state's values and legal requirements to maintain their licenses and avoid potential penalties.

11. Online gambling advertising regulations in Maryland
Online gambling advertising regulations in Maryland are not explicitly detailed in the state's statutes, as online gambling is largely illegal in the state except for daily fantasy sports and horse race betting. Maryland does not have a regulated internet poker or casino market, which means there are no specific advertising regulations for these types of online gambling.

However, advertisers and operators of online gambling sites must be cautious when promoting their services in Maryland since the state prohibits all forms of gambling activities, except for those specifically allowed by law. Activities such as betting, wagering, or gambling, as well as keeping, renting, or establishing buildings for betting, wagering, or gambling, are all illegal and may lead to penalties.

Advertising legal forms of online gambling in Maryland, such as daily fantasy sports and horse race betting, should be done in compliance with the regulations governing each specific industry. For daily fantasy sports, Maryland law imposes a $1,000 deposit limit for players and does not allow contests on college sports. Advertisements for these legal online activities should adhere to their respective guidelines and restrictions to avoid any potential legal issues.

In summary, since most forms of online gambling are prohibited in Maryland, there are no specific advertising regulations directly addressing this matter. However, advertisers must ensure they are promoting legal activities and comply with the existing regulations for each industry to avoid facing any penalties or legal repercussions.

For instance, FanDuel provides a "bet $5 and get $150 in bonus bets" offer for new players, while BetMGM grants up to $1,000 in bonus bets with the promo code PLAY1000. Users have the advantage of choosing from different sportsbooks based on their strengths in aspects like competitive odds, live betting, market diversity, promotions, and ease of navigation.

In addition to online sports betting, Maryland also permits retail sports betting, with the first retail sportsbook opening in December 2021. The state is also home to the prestigious horse racing event, the Preakness Stakes, and in 2023, FedExField is set to become the first NFL stadium to open a retail sportsbook.

Maryland sports betting market has experienced significant growth since its inception. In March 2023, the state's sports betting handle reached $385.9 million, a 12% increase from the previous month, while revenue hit $44.5 million, marking a 15% growth from February.

In summary, online sports betting in Maryland has been legal since 2021, with nine sportsbook apps available for users to choose from, and up to 60 licenses permitted by law. With a growing market and several available options, sports betting enthusiasts in Maryland have plenty of opportunities to make their bets on legal platforms.

12. Online sports betting in Maryland
Maryland legalized online sports betting through the passage of House Bill 0940 (HB0940), which was approved by Governor Larry Hogan on May 18th, 2021. HB0940, which became Chapter 356, authorizes sports wagering license holders to accept wagers on sporting events via certain methods and locations, and provides a regulatory framework for fantasy gaming competitions. 

Some key highlights of Maryland's approach to online sports betting include:

1. License holders: The bill allows sports wagering license holders to accept wagers on sporting events through specific methods and locations. This permits both online and in-person sports betting.

2. Fantasy competition operators: Operators must register with the State Lottery and Gaming Control Commission before offering competitions or services. The Commission is authorized to impose a fee for operator registration.

3. The Small, Minority-Owned, and Women-Owned Business Sports Wagering Assistance Fund: HB0940 creates this fund to assist certain businesses entering the sports wagering market.

4. Committee involvement: The bill was first referred to the Ways and Means committee in the House and the Budget and Taxation committee in the Senate.

5. Timeline and approval process: HB0940 was first introduced in the House on February 2, 2021, and subsequently went through various hearings, committee votes, amendments, and motions in both the House and Senate. The bill passed the Senate (47-0) and House (124-14), and was approved by the Governor on May 18, 2021.

6. Supplementary appropriation: The text includes a provision for additional funding to support the implementation of sports wagering.

7. Multiple topics covered: The bill addresses various subjects such as counties, appeals, attorney general, auditors, education, fees, fingerprinting, investigations, and lottery and gaming control agency. The text also includes provisions related to minorities, nonprofits, and revenue and taxes.

8. Counties specifically mentioned: The bill refers to specific counties within Maryland, such as Prince George's and Worcester.

9. Cited statutes: The statutes cited in the bill are located in Articles 5 and 9 of the Maryland code, which pertain to education and state government, respectively.

Online sports betting in Maryland aims to increase state revenue and provide new opportunities for small, minority-owned, and women-owned businesses. With regulations now in place, the state expects the sports betting market to grow and contribute to Maryland's economy.

12. Online sports betting in Maryland
Maryland is unlikely to have online sports betting in 2022, as the Maryland Sports Wagering Application Review Committee (SWARC) has made little progress in establishing guidelines for awarding competitive licenses and ensuring minority- and women-owned business participation in the state's sports betting industry. A recent industry source claimed that launching online sports betting even by the 2023 Super Bowl would be a stretch, while a top Maryland regulator had previously stated that the launch might happen in late 2022.

There is an ongoing disparity study to determine if SWARC needs to make special accommodations to include minority- and women-owned businesses in the Maryland sports betting industry, which is currently the main holdup for online sports betting moving forward. Meanwhile, an educational seminar aimed at small businesses potentially looking to apply for up to 30 competitive retail and 60 online licenses was held, but attracted only around 90 attendees and a few quality applicants.

In November 2020, Maryland voters approved sports betting, and five Maryland casinos launched retail sports betting in December 2021. Since then, these casinos have handled $132.6 million in wagers, with FanDuel Sportsbook at Live! Casino ranking among the top retail sportsbooks in the country. There are 17 entities named to receive retail licenses, with four more locations working towards opening their retail sportsbooks. Currently, ten operator applicants are vying for online sports betting licenses in Maryland.

However, it is important to note that online sports betting remains unavailable in Maryland for the time being, and the path towards legalization is still uncertain. Legal sports betting markets in the United States currently include Arizona, Calgary, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ontario, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.

12. Online sports betting in Maryland
Maryland online sports betting is expected to start in late November or early December 2021 after the state's Sports Betting Application Review Commission (SWARC) approves licenses for various operators. Governor Larry Hogan signed a bill legalizing sports betting in Maryland in May, and since then, 17 sports betting licenses have been approved. The state is set to generate millions of dollars in revenue from this industry, which will be used to fund public education.

The launch of online sports betting in Maryland coincides with the start of the NFL season and the holiday season, making it an optimal time for bettors. Maryland received 10 applications from mobile sports-betting operators ahead of the initial deadline, and more were expected before the deadline on Friday. The state has authorized SWARC to award up to 60 mobile licenses in total.

SWARC will present the license applications to the Maryland State Lottery and Gaming Control Agency at its October 27 meeting. Maryland voters legalized sports betting in 2020 through a ballot question, and the General Assembly passed a law setting the framework for the industry in 2021. While land-based sportsbooks opened at state casinos in late 2021, mobile sports gambling has yet to be launched.

Although some observers were disappointed about not having mobile betting available for the start of the football season, the revenue generated by mobile sports gambling is projected to contribute millions of dollars to the state in 2023. However, it should be noted that the revenue from mobile sports betting will not surpass the revenue generated by the state's casinos. Overall, Maryland joins a growing list of states that have legalized sports betting in recent years.

13. The role of technology and innovation in Maryland's online gambling industry
The role of technology and innovation in Maryland's online gambling industry is significant, as it contributes to the growth and expansion of this sector. Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) has recently qualified for an online sports wagering operator license in Maryland. GiG's subsidiary, iGaming Cloud Inc., has entered into a service agreement with local start-up Crab Sports Maryland LLC to operate Maryland betting app platforms. Under this agreement, iGaming Cloud Inc. will provide GiG's player account management system and Sportnco's wagering platform, with exclusive rights to operate the gaming platforms.

GiG and Crab Sports have been awarded an online wagering license by the Maryland Sports Wagering Application Review Commission (SWARC).

This collaboration aims to expand the reach of GiG's iGaming platform and sportsbook in North America, including Maryland.

The iGaming Cloud and GiG entities were approved by SWARC without going through the license award process, and businesses found qualified as online and facility sports wagering operators are eligible to partner with entities that already hold licenses awarded by SWARC. This shows the importance of technology and innovation in the Maryland online gambling industry, as it facilitates partnerships and licensing for businesses in this sector.

BetMaryland, an online sports betting platform, offers promo codes for various sports events and bets, adding another technological aspect to the state's gambling industry. This platform is owned by GDC Media Limited and licensed to GDC America Inc. The legal gambling age in Maryland is 21+, and terms and conditions apply.

In Maryland, the role of technology and innovation is crucial for the development and implementation of the online gambling industry. The state has seen a significant push towards digital betting platforms, with at least 10 online sportsbooks, including Caesars, DraftKings, and FanDuel, applying for mobile sports betting licenses.

13. The role of technology and innovation in Maryland's online gambling industry
The role of technology and innovation in Maryland's online gambling industry is evident in the growth and expansion of sports wagering and online gaming platforms in the state. In Maryland, there has been a significant increase in the number of licensed online sports wagering operators and mobile betting applications. These platforms offer an appealing and user-friendly experience for bettors, often utilizing sophisticated algorithms and powerful data analytics to make predictions and odds.

A recent example of technology's impact in the region includes the qualification of iGamingCloud as an online sports wagering operator in Maryland. This development does not require further approval, and the company is now eligible to partner with Crab Sports and Jimmy's Famous Seafood. This partnership will create opportunities for bettors to use digital platforms provided by iGamingCloud and its partners, enhancing the online gambling experience in the state.

The growth of mobile betting and retail sportsbooks in Maryland has helped generate substantial revenue for the state. In February alone, Maryland's ten retail and eight mobile sportsbooks generated $2.8 million in revenue, 96% of which came from mobile betting. The state's revenue from sports wagers increased from $440,000 in December to $2.1 million in January, which reflects the increased adoption of technology in the industry.

Further, the approval of two mobile sports wagering licenses for Whitman Gaming and the Veterans Services Corp showcases the continuing expansion of mobile sports betting in Maryland. After final approval, these businesses may complete controlled demonstrations with the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission before betting begins, indicating the involvement of technology and innovation in the certification process.

Lastly, the integration of technology in the industry has also contributed to social efforts, as the state requires sportsbooks to contribute 15% of taxable wins to an education reform fund. To date, Maryland's sports wagering program has generated $11.5 million for the fund, showing that technology not only drives the gambling industry but also supports social causes in the state.

13. The role of technology and innovation in Maryland's online gambling industry
The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency leveraged technology and innovation to adapt to remote work during the COVID-19 crisis, ensuring the continued growth of the state's online gambling industry. By utilizing virtual desktop technology, the agency managed to keep its operations up and running with minimal disruption.

A key factor to the successful transition was the agency's modern IT infrastructure, which was built on the Nutanix hypervisor and enterprise cloud operating system. This allowed the CIO to choose desktop as a service (DaaS) as a more efficient alternative to purchasing individual laptops for every employee when remote work became necessary.

Implementing Nutanix Xi Frame within a few days, the agency was able to stream business applications from its data center to employees, who could then work from any location using a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone browser. By paying via subscription, the agency can cover short timeframes and adjust its remote work setup as needed, providing flexibility in response to the pandemic.

The use of DaaS and enterprise cloud technology demonstrates how IT solutions are being redefined for remote work environments. As virtual desktop connections can be established rapidly, they help reduce the time and resources otherwise spent on securing, tracking, and updating company-issued hardware.

Private cloud technology enabled the agency's IT team to support every employee remotely, even during challenging and unpredictable times. With Nutanix Frame, the need to purchase laptops and issue them to end-users is eliminated.

Hyperconverged infrastructure plays a critical role in providing agility and flexibility to support the changing needs of Maryland's online gambling industry. As a result, IT managers must consider how to be more agile and adapt quickly in times of crisis, ensuring the continued growth and success of the industry.

For gamblers in Maryland, responsible gambling includes keeping track of money spent, setting limits, establishing a separate budget, and limiting the time spent on gambling.

Additionally, gamblers should avoid impulse or emotional reactions and seek help if gambling becomes a problem.

Best practices for gambling providers involve educating and informing patrons, providing resources on responsible gambling and problem gambling, training staff, prohibiting drunk or impaired patrons from gambling, enforcing age restrictions, and promoting responsible gambling in marketing efforts.

Signs of problem gambling may include arguing about gambling, hiding it from others, irritability when not gambling, experiencing extreme emotional swings, borrowing money or selling items unexpectedly, failing to pay bills, neglecting personal hygiene, and missing work or school repeatedly.
