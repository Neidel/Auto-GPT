Summary:
Maryland will launch mobile and online sports betting on Wednesday, November 23, 2022. The state expects to generate $26.4 million in tax revenue in its first year of mobile and online sports betting. The tax revenue from sports betting will go towards funding education programs that are part of the Maryland Department of Education’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Fund. Maryland recently legalized online sports betting and regulators approved 10 sportsbook operators, including Barstool Sportsbook, BetMGM, BetRivers, Caesars, DraftKings, FanDuel, and PointsBet. Marylanders can place wagers starting Wednesday on all major league sports, college football and basketball, certain international competitions, and more. Maryland joins other nearby states such as Virginia and DC in legalizing online sports betting. Concerns exist that mobile sports betting may lead to more people developing gambling addictions, particularly among young adults. Some states that have legalized sports betting have seen lower-than-expected tax revenues from the industry.

Summary:
- The laws in the Maryland Code are passed by the Maryland General Assembly.
- A proposed law is known as a bill, which can be introduced in either chamber of the Maryland legislature.
- After a bill is introduced, it will be referred to one or more standing committees, which determine whether a bill should move forward and can propose amendments to a bill.
- If a bill passes through the committee phase, it will return to the chamber in which it was introduced for discussion and voting.
- Once the bill has been finalized and passed by both chambers, the Governor of Maryland will review it and may sign the bill into law, take no action (which means it will become law), or veto the bill.
- If the Governor vetoes the bill, it will return to the legislature, which can vote to override the veto and pass the bill into law. Overriding the Governor's veto requires a 60 percent majority vote in each chamber of the legislature.
- The Maryland Code contains laws and statutes for various years, ranging from 2005 to 2021.
- Justia is a legal portal that provides help and marketing solutions, and has a Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
